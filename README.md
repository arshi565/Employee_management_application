Employee Management Application
This is a web-based employee management application built using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. It allows users to register new employees and manage existing ones.

Installation
To install the application, simply download the files and open index.html in your web browser. Alternatively, you can host the files on a web server and access the application through the server's URL.

Usage
Upon opening the application, you will be presented with the home page, which includes a header, search bar, and navigation menu. The navigation menu includes options for registering a new employee and viewing the list of existing employees.

Registering a New Employee
To register a new employee, click on the "Register Employee" option in the navigation menu. This will take you to the employee registration page, where you can fill out the employee's details, including name, position, about, and joining date. All fields are mandatory.

Once you have filled out the form, click on the "Submit" button to save the employee's details in the browser storage. You will be redirected to the employee listing page.

Viewing the Employee List
To view the list of existing employees, click on the "Employee List" option in the navigation menu. This will take you to the employee listing page, which displays a table of all the employees. The table includes columns for name, position, about, and joining date.

Each row in the table includes a "Delete" button, which you can use to remove the corresponding employee from the UI and browser storage. Additionally, there is a pagination feature that displays 5 employees per page.

Searching for Employees
To search for employees by name, simply type the employee's name in the search bar. The list of employees will be filtered to display only those whose name matches the search query.
